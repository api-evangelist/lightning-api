  A "Lightning API" typically refers to an application programming interface
  (API) that provides access to real-time lightning strike data, allowing
  developers to integrate information about lightning activity into their
  applications, such as weather apps, by retrieving details like location, time,
  and type of lightning strike from a weather data provider like Vaisala
  Xweather or Weatherbit; essentially, it lets you pull live lightning data to
  display on a map or within your application.
